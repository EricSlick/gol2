Project: Game of Life 2

Note: Since I did this test three years ago, I decided that just re-submitting the old code was insufficient and have
      re-implemented with the main goal of showing how my skills have improved over the last three years. Because I'm
      expanding the goals of the normal test, I expect it to take me longer than usual. I've created a rough timeline
      of when I started and when I finished along with notes on what I was doing, researching, thinking, etc.

Goals:
 Implementation
   - recreate a cleaner and more efficient version of GOL compared with the last submission
   - add one or two new features to give a twist on the basic "game" by giving it a gaming twist of some sort.
   - improve on the visual aspects of the last version.
   - improve the UI
   - more efficient memory handling (IE, reduce GC activity)
     - perhaps tweak the GC settings
   - a more efficient runtime

 Testing
   - Use TDD
   - Add a BDD aspect using rspec without Cucumber (an alternative approach to creating BDD tests I used based on
       a fellow developer's thoughts and ideas on a cleaner (and more limited) approach to integration/bdd type testing.

Design
 Base
   - Implement Conway's Game of Life
 Extended
   - Implement competing cell groups (evolve the cells and implement some sort of attraction to keep them grouped
   - UI allows for realtime tweaks to the GOL and allow player competition against the computer

Tools
  - RubyMine 8.0.2
  - Ruby 2.3.4
  - rvm
  - git 2.6.3

3:00 - 3:30 (ish)
  - after chatting with Shelly, looked up old code, and decided to re-implement rather than just improve.
  - pulled down and looked over old code
  - thought through some ideas on what I could do to improve on it

12/30/2015
  - morning
    - briefly set up project as a gem using bundler
  - break (family and holiday stuff)
    - Thinking about what I could do to extend the design of GOL that was reasonable to do in a short timeframe
  - 3:30 (setup)
    - set up this worklog.txt and created a basic goal and put down extended design ideas
    - added gemset and ruby version
    - decided to update to ruby 2.3.4
    - bundler/rspec
  - 4:10 (started first test)
